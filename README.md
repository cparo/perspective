Perspective
===========

Graphing library for quality control in event-driven systems.

This is obviously a work in progress - and subject to major changes in both
interface and implementation until this README is changed to say otherwise.

The ultimate intention is to provide:
* A library of visualization-generation objects
* A set of command-line utilities for generating visualizations with those
  objects
* An HTTP service for generating visualizations with those objects
* A reference graphical web application for using the HTTP visualization
  service
